Purchasing a Home using data from Redfin

1. In this project I will download data with Redfin for customers looking to buy a home.

2. Previously customers were manually putting data down into Excel and adding / crossing off data with updates with pen and paper.

3. My goal is to determine if data that changes online, specifically price, can be reflected in an Excel sheet.

4. Secondary goal is to add a column using a graph that shows the home buyers what the price change over time indicates.
